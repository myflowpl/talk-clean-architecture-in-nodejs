# Clean Architecture in NodeJS [EN]
This are slides to the talk give on [WarsawJS #39 meetup](https://www.meetup.com/WarsawJS/events/244354442/)

[See the slides online](https://myflowpl.github.io/talk-clean-architecture-in-nodejs/)

In this talk, I’ll show you my implementation of Clean Architecture in NodeJS. 

If you are not familiar with the concept, you should look for Rober C. Martin talks. 

Due to the time limit, I’m going to do only the short introduction to CA, enough to inspire you to go deeper on the subject. 

Next, I’ll show you some useful tools in our JavaScript world to achieve good architecture design. We will use TypeScript to model your domain, IversifyJS to connect your application layers, TSOA to expose your REST API and generate Swagger contract. Swagger will allow you to generate great documentation and API clients in around 20+ other languages. In the end, you will be able to create testable, frameworks independent application.
